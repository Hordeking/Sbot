Spiderbot hard-codes the data/code locations. This is where we dump in file form the referenced sections. Optionally can describe them here.

Filename	AtAddr	Length	Length	Purpose
bootsector.asm	0x0000	512B	1 sector	First Stage Bootloader
bootload-stg2.bin	0x1c00	2048B	4 sectors	Second Stage Bootloader
executive	0x2400	148608	many	Real executive. 148608 bytes long.

mzfile.bin is the raw executive, which spiderbot loads from the disk and sets up its header to relocate it. I still have yet to figure out how this is working. Spiderbot loads it to 0x2800 and goes from there. On disk, it's stored a little strangely, The first 8 sectors of cylinders 1-33 in order, then it swings back and copies the 9th sector of cyls 1-26, plus just the bytes required from the 9th sector of the 27th cylinder (128 bytes). All of this one side 0 of the disk. These bytes should add up to precisely 148608 bytes.

Formula is: max_cyls_8sect*8*512 + max_cyls_9thsect*1*512 + bytes_in_final_sect

Spiderbot itself is:
	Cylinders 1-33, First 8 sectors of each are placed consecutively
	Cylinders 1-26, 9th sectors consec
	Culinder 27, first 128 bytes of sector 9
